Exercise 4 - Divisors

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list 
of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, 
it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
